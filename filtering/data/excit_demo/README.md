raw data from sensors:(â‰ˆ20,000 x 7)
1. `excit_acc_record.txt`: acceleration reading
2. `excit_ang_record.txt`: angle reading (radian)
3. `excit_vel_record.txt`: velocity reading
4. `excit_torque_record.txt`: torque reading from joint sensor
5. `excit_motor_record.txt`: torque reading from motor

after data filtering, the filtered data will be stored in `data_filtering.mat`
